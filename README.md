# Strava for Lyyyyffe
Total geek terrain here

This is a test space that I use to track my strava stats and play with various visualization and
Python development options! Enter at your own risk. :)

### Basic Installation

Clone locally

To run in interactive (development) mode:

`$ pip install -e .`

Play with the notebooks. I'm not sure that i've setup the authentication in a way that others
can use this yet I believe I need to add instructions for setup of your strava app, secret and code.

more to come...maybe :)


## Requirements

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`conda activate strava-lyfe`

`jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly@4.14.3`


If using JupyterLab, install the plotly extension

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab-plotly-extension`
